# Caesar and Vigen√®re Decryptor

---

Welcome to the **Caesar and Vigen√®re Decryptor**! This project is my first significant endeavor into the world of Python programming, showcasing a practical application of foundational cryptographic concepts. It's designed to decrypt messages encoded with both the classic Caesar cipher and the more advanced Vigen√®re cipher.

## üåü Features

* **Intelligent Cipher Detection:** The program automatically determines whether to use Caesar or Vigen√®re decryption based on the type of key provided. If the key is numeric, it's treated as a Caesar shift; if it's alphanumeric, it's used as a Vigen√®re keyword.
* **Caesar Cipher Decryption:** Easily decrypt messages encrypted with a Caesar cipher by providing the numerical shift key.
* **Vigen√®re Cipher Decryption:** Decipher messages encoded with a Vigen√®re cipher, requiring the original keyword.
* **Intuitive Command-Line Interface:** A user-friendly interface guides you through the decryption process, making it simple to input the necessary information.
* **Robust Error Handling:** Designed to gracefully handle invalid inputs, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Python 3:** The core language used for developing the decryption logic.

## üöÄ Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You'll need Python 3 installed on your system. If you don't have it, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/suveer-dhawan/caesar-vigenere-decryptor.git](https://github.com/suveer-dhawan/caesar-vigenere-decryptor.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd caesar-vigenere-decryptor
    ```

### How to Run

1.  **Execute the `decryptor.py` script:**

    ```bash
    python decryptor.py
    ```

2.  **Follow the on-screen prompts:**
    * Enter your encrypted message.
    * Provide the decryption key. The program will automatically apply either Caesar or Vigen√®re decryption based on whether the key is numeric or a word.

## üí° Example Usage

### Caesar Cipher Decryption (with a numerical key)

```
DECRYPT STRING
Input encrypted string: KHOOR ZRUOG
Input key: 3
The decrypted string is:
HELLOWORLD
```

### Vigen√®re Cipher Decryption (with a word key)

```
DECRYPT STRING
Input encrypted string: RPDQHV GDB
Input key: LEMON
The decrypted string is:
EXAMPLEONE
```

## üß† How it Works

The project intelligently implements the decryption algorithms for both ciphers:

* **Automatic Key Detection:** The `decrypt_cypher` function inspects the provided key. If it's purely numeric, it's converted to an integer and passed to the `caesar_cypher` function. Otherwise, it's treated as a string keyword and passed to the `vigenere_cipher` function.
* **Caesar Cipher:** Each letter in the ciphertext is shifted back a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, 'D' would become 'A'.
* **Vigen√®re Cipher:** A polyalphabetic substitution cipher that uses a keyword. Each letter of the plaintext is encrypted using a different Caesar cipher determined by the corresponding letter of the keyword. Decryption reverses this process using the same keyword.
